ðŸ’¬ About me ...

  ##### I'm Felipe Alves, I'm 27 years old and I'm a resident of SÃ£o JoÃ£o de Meriti, RJ.

  ##### In the middle of 2019, I started to like the development area after participating in Hacking. Rio 2019, where my team won the Digital Platforms Cooperative cluster, we won 1st place.

  ##### This sparked my interest in learning to develop, and then I started to study on my own and take some courses. With that, I learned a lot, and did some projects. Where I was sure that was what I wanted for myself. And in this year of 2020, I participated in another Hackathon, but online. In which, I graduated as a Front-End Developer.
  ##### I study every day, and I try to grow in this area, which I loved.

  ##### I want to be able to be part of the future and current achievements of the company, to be able to add knowledge and also contribute to the team.
